**aeRAG: A Scalable Modular Knowledge System**

# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Context and Project Origin
Archethic is a **transaction chain** that introduces a number of innovations beyond what most traditional blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Bitcoin, Cosmos) provide. Despite its unique capabilities—such as enhanced security models, improved transaction handling, and a more scalable architecture—**the complexity of its underlying technology** can make it difficult to explain, learn, and adopt.

To tackle this issue, we aim to develop a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that unifies Archethic’s data (source code, commits, issues, pull requests, developer documentation, community discussions, etc.) into a single, easily accessible knowledge base. By bridging natural language queries with relevant, curated project data, we hope to improve:
- **Technical clarity** for developers looking to build decentralized applications (DApps) on Archethic.  
- **Transparency** for potential investors who need quick, accurate insights into the technology’s fundamentals and roadmap.  
- **Efficiency** for members of the Archethic Foundation who want to query existing data, code, and documents rapidly.  
- **Community engagement** by enabling content creators and ecosystem advocates to generate reliable articles, FAQs, and promotional materials.  
- **Scalability** by ensuring that as the ecosystem grows, the system can integrate new data sources and retrieval methods efficiently.

## 1.2 Main Objective
The overarching goal is to provide a comprehensive, AI-powered solution that can accurately answer a wide range of questions—from deep technical queries about node configurations or smart contract development, to higher-level inquiries about Archethic’s value proposition and economic model.

Furthermore, the system is designed with **replicability and extensibility** in mind: the same architecture and codebase can be **reused for other projects** by simply **adjusting configuration files** and data-collection endpoints to suit each new context. By abstracting data collection, storage, and retrieval processes, aeRAG can be adapted for different blockchain ecosystems or even non-blockchain domains.

## 1.3 Scope of This Document
This document details:
- **High-Level Architecture** of the RAG pipeline: from data collection in GitHub repositories, to chunking and embedding content, to producing final answers through a Large Language Model (LLM).
- **Implementation Details** of the current system: how MongoDB is used to store, query, and index data; how chunking strategies differ between code and text; and how metadata such as summaries and keywords are generated.
- **Future Extensions** including advanced retrieval logic, integration with vector databases (e.g., Faiss, LlamaIndex, or Milvus), query optimization techniques (SQL-based retrieval, dynamic reasoning, multi-step planning), and support for multiple LLM backends (Mistral, DeepSeek, OpenAI, etc.).
- **Deployment Considerations** for local or cloud-based environments.  
- **Testing and Maintenance** approaches that ensure the system remains robust, accurate, and easy to evolve over time.  
- **User Interface and Accessibility** by discussing how aeRAG can be integrated into **chatbots, API endpoints, and other interactive platforms** to make knowledge retrieval as seamless as possible.

By offering a **modular, well-structured** RAG solution, this project aims to **accelerate Archethic’s adoption** and empower its community with a reliable, user-friendly tool for exploring, understanding, and leveraging the technology’s full potential. Additionally, it serves as a blueprint for any ecosystem looking to integrate RAG-based AI-driven knowledge retrieval.

# 2. Requirements and Use Cases

## 2.1 Functional Requirements

### 2.1.1 Data Collection
- **GitHub Integration**:  
  The system must be able to fetch code, commits, pull requests, issues, and release notes from Archethic’s (or any other project's) GitHub repositories. This includes handling authentication (e.g., OAuth tokens), pagination, and rate limits.
- **Extended Data Sources**:  
  While GitHub is the primary data source initially, the architecture should support plugging in additional data feeds (e.g., forum posts, technical blogs, governance records). Configuration files or environment variables should make it simple to add or remove these sources.

### 2.1.2 Data Organization and Indexing
- **Structured Storage in MongoDB**:  
  Each type of data (e.g., commits, issues, code files) is stored in dedicated MongoDB collections. The system must maintain references between these collections (e.g., issues linked to related pull requests).
- **Metadata Generation**:  
  The system must generate extended metadata for each file or record, including:
  - **Text chunking** (custom size, overlap, or code syntax-aware).  
  - **Embeddings** (e.g., with SentenceTransformers).  
  - **Summaries** (T5 Summarizer or equivalent).  
  - **Keywords** (Yake or any other configured extractor).
- **Vector Index Support**:  
  Even though MongoDB houses the core data, the system should be designed to integrate with a vector database (e.g., Faiss, LlamaIndex, Milvus) for rapid similarity searches on embeddings.

### 2.1.3 Retrieval-Augmented Queries
- **Similarity Search**:  
  For any incoming natural language query, the system must locate the most relevant chunks (via embeddings) and produce a concise context for the LLM.
- **LLM Interaction**:  
  The pipeline should support hooking up multiple LLMs (Mistral, DeepSeek, OpenAI, etc.). Internally, the system organizes the context, merges it with user queries, and delegates the final text generation to the chosen model.

### 2.1.4 Chatbot / API Interface
- **User Interaction**:  
  The solution should provide at least a chatbot-like interface, whether through a CLI, a web-based UI, or both.
- **API Access** *(Planned)*:  
  An HTTP endpoint (e.g., REST or GraphQL) may be exposed so external applications can query the system programmatically.

### 2.1.5 Logging and Monitoring
- **Request Logs**:  
  Each query, along with the relevant chunks retrieved and LLM response, should be optionally logged for future analysis (with attention to privacy/security concerns).
- **System Health**:  
  Basic metrics (e.g., memory usage, response times, indexing completion stats) are necessary for debugging and optimization.

### 2.1.6 Testing (Unit and Non-Regression)
- **Unit Tests**:  
  Each module (collectors, chunkers, embeddings, metadata management) should include tests to confirm expected behavior.
- **Integration & Non-Regression Tests**:  
  The system should run scenario-based tests (e.g., retrieving commits for a specific repo, chunking and vectorizing them, ensuring results remain consistent over time).

---

## 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

### 2.2.1 Performance and Scalability
- **Low Latency Retrieval**:  
  The system must return relevant chunks quickly, especially in conversational use cases. This requirement often drives the need for an **ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbor) index** in a vector database.
- **Horizontal Scalability**:  
  As more data sources are added, the system should handle increased storage and indexing loads via horizontal scaling. For instance, separate microservices could handle chunking, vector indexing, and LLM calls.

### 2.2.2 Reliability and Fault Tolerance
- **Robust Error Handling**:  
  If a collector encounters an error (e.g., a GitHub rate limit), it should retry gracefully or log the issue without halting the entire pipeline.
- **Retry and Rollback**:  
  Large-scale indexing processes might fail mid-way; the system should be able to resume or roll back partial updates.

### 2.2.3 Maintainability and Clean Code
- **Modular Architecture**:  
  Each functionality (data collection, chunking, embeddings, etc.) is self-contained with clear interfaces. This fosters easier upgrades and refactoring.
- **Adherence to Clean Code Principles**:  
  Following Robert C. Martin’s guidelines (SOLID, DRY, etc.) ensures the code remains approachable for new contributors.
- **Documentation**:  
  Clear in-code docstrings and external documentation for each module so that maintainers can easily extend or modify the system.

### 2.2.4 Security and Access Control
- **Token Management**:  
  Credentials for GitHub or other data sources must be stored securely, e.g., in environment variables or a secrets manager.
- **User Data Privacy**:  
  If personal or sensitive data is ever ingested, the system must comply with relevant privacy regulations and best practices.  
- **Network Restrictions**:  
  For enterprise or closed-source usage, there may be a requirement to restrict external LLM calls or manage them via secure proxies.

### 2.2.5 Portability
- **Local vs. Cloud Deployments**:  
  The system should support easy installation on a local machine (e.g., on-premise server) or container-based deployment in the cloud.
- **Minimal External Dependencies**:  
  While vector databases or advanced LLMs might be optional add-ons, the core pipeline should remain functional and not break if certain optional dependencies are missing or swapped.

# 3. High-Level Architecture

This chapter provides a **bird’s-eye view** of the aeRAG system—how data travels from raw sources (like GitHub) through chunking, embedding, and indexing, and ultimately how it’s fed to a Large Language Model (LLM) to answer user queries. The architecture is designed around **modularity** and **extensibility**, ensuring new data sources, vector databases, or LLM backends can be added with minimal friction.

---

## 3.1 Overview of the RAG Pipeline

1. **Data Collection**  
   - The system periodically or on-demand fetches information from configured sources (primarily GitHub).  
   - Each repository’s commits, issues, pull requests, and files are retrieved and stored.

2. **Data Storage**  
   - Retrieved data is structured and saved in MongoDB (or any chosen database).  
   - Collections such as `commits`, `issues`, `pull_requests`, `main_files`, etc., store relevant metadata and references.

3. **Document Chunking**  
   - Each stored file or piece of text is **split** into manageable chunks for fine-grained retrieval.  
   - aeRAG uses **overlapping text-based** or **language-specific code** chunking strategies to preserve context.

4. **Vectorization**  
   - Each chunk is embedded into a vector space using a chosen embedding model (e.g., SentenceTransformers).  
   - The resulting vectors are stored, either directly in MongoDB or in a vector database (planned feature).

5. **Vector Database Indexing (Planned)**  
   - For faster similarity searches, embeddings may be indexed in a specialized vector DB (Faiss, LlamaIndex, or Milvus).  
   - The system can fall back to MongoDB-based indexing if a vector DB is unavailable or optional for smaller deployments.

6. **Retrieval & RAG Engine**  
   - Upon user query, the engine searches for top-k similar chunks based on semantic similarity.  
   - The system compiles relevant chunks into a context package.

7. **LLM Integration**  
   - The context package and user query are passed to the selected LLM (Mistral, DeepSeek, OpenAI, etc.).  
   - The LLM returns an answer that is more accurate and context-aware, thanks to the RAG pipeline.

8. **User Interaction**  
   - Interactions can occur via a CLI chatbot, web UI, or an API endpoint.  
   - Query logs or results can be monitored for debugging and continuous improvement.

## 3.2 Key Components and Their Roles

### 3.2.1 Collectors
**Primary Purpose**: Gather data from external sources, especially GitHub, and insert or update that data in MongoDB.

1. **GitHubCollector**  
   - Coordinates the retrieval of **commits, pull requests, issues, and file trees**.  
   - Uses submodules to handle specific data (e.g., `github_commits.py`, `github_issues.py`).  
   - Manages API rate limits, token authentication, and error handling.

2. **Collector Extensibility**  
   - Additional collectors can be created for other data sources (forums, curated docs, or even other Git platforms).  
   - Each collector follows a similar pattern: fetch data → standardize format → store in the database.

### 3.2.2 Core Database & File Storage
**Primary Purpose**: Serve as the unified data backbone, storing both raw text/code and structured metadata.

1. **DatabaseManager**  
   - Handles **MongoDB connections** and collection creation.  
   - Defines indexes for improved query performance (e.g., on `repo`, `date`, or `updated_at` fields).

2. **FileStorageManager**  
   - Manages large file content, either locally (via a simple HTTP server) or through a remote storage service.  
   - Ensures raw files remain accessible for post-processing or direct viewing.

### 3.2.3 Chunking Strategies
**Primary Purpose**: Break down large documents (code files, markdown docs, etc.) into **smaller chunks** that can be indexed and retrieved more precisely.

1. **TextChunkingStrategy**  
   - Splits text into segments based on a chosen size (e.g., 500 tokens) and overlap (e.g., 50 tokens).  
   - Useful for documentation, discussion threads, or any natural-language content.

2. **CodeChunkingStrategy**  
   - Analyzes code structure (functions, classes, imports) to split at logical boundaries.  
   - Different sub-routines exist for languages like Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, etc.

3. **ChunkingStrategyFactory**  
   - Dynamically decides which strategy to use based on file type or extension.  
   - Extendable for new formats (HTML, JSON config, etc.).

### 3.2.4 Embeddings and Metadata
**Primary Purpose**: Add **semantic layers** to the data so the RAG engine can find relevant chunks via similarity search.

1. **Embedding Models**  
   - Typically uses a `SentenceTransformerEmbeddingModel` for general semantic embeddings.  
   - Could integrate other encoders if needed (e.g., OpenAI embeddings, BERT variants).

2. **Summarizers & Keyword Extractors**  
   - Summarizers (e.g., T5) can generate short abstracts of each chunk, aiding high-level indexing.  
   - Keyword extractors (e.g., Yake) allow quick tagging and filtering.

3. **MetadataManager**  
   - Coordinates the creation of chunked documents, embeddings, summaries, and keywords.  
   - Updates or re-generates metadata if a file changes in GitHub or a new version is released.

### 3.2.5 Vector Database (Future Integration)
**Primary Purpose**: **Accelerate similarity searches** on embedded data, crucial as the dataset grows.

1. **Supported Options**  
   - **Faiss**: A library for efficient similarity search in high-dimensional spaces.  
   - **LlamaIndex or Milvus**: Alternative solutions offering advanced features (like partitioning or distributed indexes).

2. **Index Management**  
   - The system defines how embeddings are uploaded, updated, or deleted.  
   - Queries the index to retrieve the top-k results for a user’s query embedding.

### 3.2.6 RAG Engine
**Primary Purpose**: Orchestrate the retrieval and packaging of relevant context for the LLM.

1. **Similarity Search**  
   - Takes the user’s question, embeds it, and searches the vector index or fallback (MongoDB).  
   - Ranks chunks by relevance score.

2. **Context Assembly**  
   - Collects top-k chunks into a consolidated context, possibly combining multiple documents.  
   - May apply summarization or additional filtering (e.g., removing duplicates).

3. **Query Routing** (Future Feature)  
   - In more advanced modes, decides if the LLM even needs retrieval from the knowledge base (fallback to base LLM if the question is generic).  
   - Could also orchestrate multi-step plans, e.g., generating a structured query for the DB.

### 3.2.7 LLMs and Response Generation
**Primary Purpose**: **Generate answers** in natural language using the retrieved context.

1. **LLM Manager**  
   - Abstracts the interface to different LLMs (Mistral, DeepSeek, OpenAI, etc.).  
   - Passes the user query plus retrieved context to the chosen model.

2. **Prompt Engineering**  
   - Shapes how the context and user question are combined (system prompts, user prompts, or few-shot examples).  
   - Minimizes hallucination by emphasizing or injecting retrieved facts.

3. **Response Handling**  
   - Returns the LLM’s final text to the user (via CLI, web UI, or API).  
   - Optionally logs the query and final response for analysis or debugging.

### 3.2.8 Server and CLI
**Primary Purpose**: Provide **entry points** for interactive usage and automation.

1. **LocalStorageServer**  
   - A minimal HTTP server that serves raw files (such as code or logs) for convenience.  
   - Can be extended to offer a small web UI or endpoints if needed.

2. **`main.py` CLI**  
   - Interactive menu for listing repos, updating data, starting the local server, and performing metadata updates.  
   - Allows testing or demonstration of the system’s core functions in a terminal environment.

3. **Future API**  
   - A planned extension for external apps: REST or GraphQL endpoints that handle user queries.

---

## 3.3 Data Flow Diagram (Conceptual)
Below is a conceptual outline of how data moves through aeRAG. *(A text-based description is provided—feel free to create a visual diagram if desired.)*

1. **Collector** calls the GitHub API → receives commits, issues, PRs.  
2. **Collector** stores results in **MongoDB** (collections: `commits`, `issues`, etc.).  
3. **MetadataManager** reads a file or record → uses **ChunkingStrategy** to split → uses **EmbeddingModel** to produce vectors.  
4. **MetadataManager** saves chunk metadata (embedding, summary, keywords) in **MongoDB** or a **Vector DB**.  
5. At **query time**, the RAG engine:  
   - Embeds the user query → searches top-k similar chunks.  
   - Gathers context from the relevant chunk documents.  
   - Sends the context and user query to the **LLM**.  
   - LLM produces a final answer, which is returned to the user.

---

## 3.4 Architectural Rationale

1. **Separation of Concerns**  
   - Each step (collecting, chunking, embedding, retrieving, LLM generation) is modular. This allows partial upgrades (e.g., swapping out the chunking strategy or embedding model) without rewriting the entire pipeline.

2. **Incremental Adoption**  
   - The system works with just MongoDB for smaller data sets. As the data volume increases, a specialized vector DB can be integrated for speed and scalability.

3. **Scalability and Flexibility**  
   - By supporting multiple LLMs and data sources, the architecture remains future-proof.  
   - The system can scale horizontally, with separate microservices for chunking, embeddings, and search if needed.

4. **Maintainability**  
   - Clean Code patterns keep each module self-contained and testable.  
   - Clear data flows ensure developers can trace how a chunk moves from raw file to LLM prompt.

---

## 3.5 Summary
The aeRAG architecture combines **a robust ingestion pipeline** with **modular chunking, embedding, and retrieval strategies**. It leverages MongoDB for flexible document storage and aims to integrate specialized vector databases for high-speed similarity search. A dedicated RAG engine then collates context for the LLM, ultimately **enabling domain-specific, context-rich responses** for end-users.

In the **next chapter**, we will **delve deeper into the existing implementation**, showing how these architectural components map to actual modules and functions in the codebase. This includes details on how the GitHub collectors are structured, how metadata is generated and stored, and the current approach to chunking and embedding.

# 4. Current Implementation Details

Building on the **High-Level Architecture** described in Chapter 3, this chapter focuses on **how the system is implemented today (02/03/2025)**, including the structure of collectors, metadata generation, and data handling in MongoDB. **Future releases will add or modify features documented here, and a dedicated changelog will track major changes over time.**

---

## 4.1 Data Collection

### 4.1.1 GitHubCollector
- **Primary Module**: `github_collector.py`  
- **Role**: Orchestrates fetching and updating information from GitHub, including:
  - **Repository Info**: Basic metadata (description, language, URL, last commit date).  
  - **Commits**: Detailed commit logs, including author, date, changed files, and diffs.  
  - **Pull Requests**: PR titles, states, commit references, and attached comments.  
  - **Issues**: Titles, bodies, state (open/closed), labels, and discussion threads.

#### 4.1.1.1 Workflow
1. **Fetch Repository List**: A call to GitHub’s `/orgs/<org>/repos` endpoint retrieves all repos for the organization.  
2. **Update Selected Repos**: For each repo, the system fetches new commits, pull requests, and issues since the last recorded date.  
3. **Store in MongoDB**:  
   - Data gets normalized into collections like `repositories`, `commits`, `pull_requests`, `issues`, etc.  
   - Any large file content is saved separately via the `file_storage_manager.py`.

#### 4.1.1.2 Error & Rate-Limit Handling
- The collector checks GitHub’s response headers (e.g., `X-RateLimit-Remaining`) and **waits** if the rate limit is reached.  
- If requests fail, the system logs the error and **continues** processing for other repos or data types.

### 4.1.2 Additional Collector Files
- **`github_commits.py`**: Fetches commit details and changed files.  
- **`github_issues.py`**: Retrieves issues and related comments, storing them in `issues` and `issues_comments` collections.  
- **`github_pull_requests.py`**: Manages pull request data (state, associated commits, comments).  
- **`github_files.py`**: Fetches files from the main branch or the latest release tag, storing them into `main_files` or `last_release_files`.

---

## 4.2 Data Storage in MongoDB

### 4.2.1 DatabaseManager
- **File**: `database_manager.py`  
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Open a connection to the MongoDB instance.  
  - Create indices for each collection (e.g., on `repo`, `date`, `state`, or custom fields).  
  - Provide a simple `db` property to access raw PyMongo operations.

#### 4.2.1.1 Collections Overview
1. **`repositories`**:  
   - Holds basic info: `_id` (e.g., `org/repo`), description, language, URL.  
2. **`commits`**:  
   - Each commit includes metadata such as message, date, author, files changed.  
   - Linked to files in `files` or `main_files` via commit SHA references.  
3. **`pull_requests`** and **`issues`**:  
   - Each record captures title, body, creation date, labels, comments, etc.  
   - Comments are stored separately in `pull_requests_comments` and `issues_comments` to keep the main documents smaller.  
4. **`files`, `main_files`, and `last_release_files`**:  
   - Store file metadata (filename, commit ID, and external URLs to the raw content).  
5. **`metadata`**:  
   - Contains references to text chunks, embeddings, summaries, and file hashes.  
   - The `_id` often encodes the source collection and document ID (e.g., `meta_repo_commits_sha`).  
6. **`chunks`**:  
   - Stores chunk-level data (e.g., `chunk_src`, `embedding`, `metadata_id`).  
   - Links back to the `metadata` collection, enabling fine-grained retrieval.

### 4.2.2 FileStorageManager
- **File**: `file_storage_manager.py`  
- **Purpose**:
  - Writes large or raw file content to a local storage path.  
  - Generates a public (or internal) URL, which is saved into MongoDB for future retrieval or analysis.  
  - Also handles retrieving existing content if needed for re-processing.

#### 4.2.2.1 Usage Flow
1. **Store File**: On retrieving a new file from GitHub, the collector calls `store_file_content()` with `(content, repo, reference_id, filename)`.  
2. **Generate URL**: The manager returns a path like `http://localhost:8000/<repo>/<reference_id>/<filename>`.  
3. **MongoDB Reference**: This URL gets stored in a relevant collection (e.g., `main_files`).  
4. **Subsequent Access**: If a chunking process or user needs the raw file, it can fetch via this URL.

---

## 4.3 Chunking and Metadata Generation

### 4.3.1 Chunking Strategies
- **TextChunkingStrategy (`text_chunking_strategy.py`)**:  
  - Splits documents into overlapping text chunks. Typical defaults: chunk size of ~500–1000 characters and overlap of 50–200 characters.  
  - Useful for **markdown docs**, **issues** bodies, or any plain text.

- **CodeChunkingStrategy (`code_chunking_strategy.py`)**:  
  - Splits code based on classes, function definitions, imports, etc.  
  - Supports multiple languages (Python, JavaScript, Dart, Go, C/C++, Ruby, etc.) by using language-specific regex patterns.

- **ChunkingStrategyFactory (`chunking_strategy_factory.py`)**:  
  - Determines whether to treat a file as `code` or `text` based on file extensions or other metadata.  
  - **Fallback**: If the file type is unknown, it uses the text strategy.

### 4.3.2 MetadataManager
- **File**: `metadata_manager.py`  
- **Core Logic**: 
  1. **Detect File Type**: For each record (commit, file, etc.), check extension or stored metadata.  
  2. **Retrieve Content**: Fetch text from `external_url` if available, or from the `patch` field for commits.  
  3. **Chunk the Content**: Call the appropriate chunking strategy.  
  4. **Generate Embeddings**: Pass each chunk to an embedding model.  
  5. **Create Summaries & Keywords**: Use T5-based summarizers or Yake-based keyword extractors.  
  6. **Save to `metadata`** and `chunks`**: Each chunk is stored with an `_id` referencing the metadata record.

#### 4.3.2.1 Example Flow for a New File
1. A new file in `main_files` is detected with `_id: <repo>_main_<filepath>`.  
2. **`MetadataManager`** extracts text from `file_storage_manager`’s URL.  
3. Chooses `CodeChunkingStrategy` if extension is `.py`; else `TextChunkingStrategy`.  
4. The resulting chunk texts are embedded using a `SentenceTransformerEmbeddingModel` from **`embeddings.py`**.  
5. Summaries and keywords might be generated, stored in the `metadata` collection.  
6. Each chunk’s embedding and text is saved to `chunks`.

---

## 4.4 Embeddings and Summaries

### 4.4.1 Embedding Models
- **File**: `embeddings.py`  
- **Implemented Class**: `SentenceTransformerEmbeddingModel` (commonly with the `"all-MiniLM-L6-v2"` or user-specified model).  
- **Usage**:
  - `encode(text)` returns a vector (list of floats).  
  - For chunked text, this is called in a loop. The resulting vectors are inserted into the `chunks` collection along with references to the parent metadata ID.

### 4.4.2 Summarizers
- **File**: `summarizers.py`  
- **Current Approach**: A T5-based summarizer, which can compress chunked text into shorter paragraphs.  
- **Optional Step**: Summaries are not always generated for large volumes of data, as it can be time-consuming. Instead, it may be triggered on demand or for specific file types.

### 4.4.3 Keyword Extraction
- **File**: `keywords_extractors.py`  
- **Extractor Used**: Yake (`YakeKeywordExtractor`) by default.  
- **Purpose**: Assign up to 10 keywords for each content extracted to facilitate topic tagging and quick searching.

---

## 4.5 RAG Engine and Retrieval

### 4.5.1 Current Retrieval Mechanism
- **MongoDB**:  
  - Currently, the system relies on MongoDB queries combined with embedded vectors.  
  - The approach is simpler but less optimal for high-scale similarity searches.  
  - A fallback to “metadata-based” queries also exists (e.g., matching chunk labels, file names, or keywords).

**Note**: A skeleton `rag_engine.py` file exists (or is planned) to unify retrieval logic. In future iterations, it will orchestrate how queries are parsed, how chunk searches are performed, and how fallback logic is managed.

### 4.5.2 Planned Vector Index
- **Faiss / LlamaIndex**:  
  - The codebase contains placeholders or “TODO” comments for hooking into a vector database.  
  - Once integrated, each chunk embedding is pushed to the index, enabling top-k similarity searches.

### 4.5.3 LLM Integration
- **Connection Points**:
  - The pipeline can feed top-k chunks to an LLM. 
  - Chat-based usage is prototyped in `main.py`, but a more robust “RAG engine” that orchestrates chunk retrieval is under development.
- **Configurable Model**:
  - The user can specify **Mistral, DeepSeek, OpenAI GPT-4,** etc. The code is structured so that each model implements a standardized interface (see `llm_manager.py` or `llm_interface.py` in the `LLMs` folder).

---

## 4.6 Local Server and CLI

### 4.6.1 Local Storage Server
- **File**: `local_storage_server.py`  
- **Role**: Serves locally stored files (e.g., raw code from GitHub) through a simple HTTP interface.  
- **Usage**:
  - Runs typically at `localhost:8000`, so any external file references become accessible via standard HTTP requests.
- **Extension**:  
  - Could be expanded into a minimal REST API for retrieving chunk data or for chatbot integration.

### 4.6.2 `main.py` CLI
- **Interactive Menu**: Provides the user with commands such as:
  - **Listing GitHub repositories** and updating them.  
  - **Fetching and storing** new commits/issues/PR data.  
  - **Updating metadata** for selected collections (files, commits, issues, etc.).  
  - **Starting/Stopping** the local storage server.  
  - Basic logs viewing (to see if the server or collector is running smoothly).

- **Roadmap**:
  - Possibly a “Chat” option (still partially implemented) to let the user query the system from the CLI.

---

## 4.7 Example Data Flow

Consider a scenario: **New commit** made to `archethic-foundation/core-engine` with a patch for improving transaction logic.

1. **GitHubCollector** → detects new commits since last fetch.  
2. Commit details stored in `commits` collection, associated files in `main_files`.  
3. `MetadataManager` → sees an unprocessed commit or file.  
4. **Chunk** the file if it’s new or changed.  
5. **Embed** the chunk text, store vectors in `chunks`.  
6. On user query, e.g., “How does Archethic handle transaction throughput?”  
7. The system (currently) searches `chunks` by textual keywords or naive embedding similarity in MongoDB. (Advanced: hits Faiss index in future).  
8. Assembles the top relevant chunks, merges them, and sends them to an LLM for an answer.

---

## 4.8 Limitations in the Current Implementation

1. **No Dedicated Vector DB**  
   - Reliance on MongoDB’s basic queries or naive embedding search can be slow at scale.  
   - The upcoming integration of Faiss or LlamaIndex is expected to **greatly improve** retrieval performance.

2. **Minimal RAG Engine**  
   - There is no sophisticated fallback logic (e.g., deciding whether to query the knowledge base at all).  
   - Multi-step reasoning (like generating SQL or advanced queries) is not implemented yet.

3. **Limited UI/UX**  
   - The user interacts via CLI or a very basic local HTTP server.  
   - A modern, **user-friendly** solution could be:
     1. **A minimal web-based chatbot** (e.g., built with React, Vue, or Svelte) that calls the RAG API, displaying results in real time.  
     2. **Plugin-based integration** with popular chat platforms (e.g., Slack, Discord) for collaborative usage.
   - Either approach would prioritize ease of access, a clean interface, and real-time feedback for end users.

4. **Automatic Summarization**  
   - Summaries can be expensive. Currently, summary generation is triggered manually for large volumes of data.  
   - **Two possible enhancements**:  
     1. **Batch Summarization**: Summaries are generated in bulk after certain thresholds (e.g., once daily or weekly).  
     2. **More Efficient Model**: A GPU-accelerated or lighter summarization model could handle large-scale data without blocking processes.

---

## 4.9 Summary

The current state of **aeRAG** already provides:
- **End-to-end GitHub data collection** and structured storage in MongoDB.  
- **Document chunking** with strategies for both textual and code-based content.  
- **Embedding-based** metadata generation (via SentenceTransformers), plus optional summaries and keywords.  
- A **CLI-driven workflow** to fetch data, chunk, embed, and prepare it for retrieval.

Upcoming expansions—like vector database integration, an enhanced RAG engine, and more sophisticated LLM prompts—will **transform** this from a **basic aggregator** into a **fully featured** retrieval and conversation system.

**This chapter reflects the codebase as of 02/03/2025; subsequent updates will be tracked in a dedicated changelog for easier versioning.**

Below is a **restructured Chapter 5**, renamed **“Technical Proposals for Next Steps.”** We have **removed** the explicit roadmap and milestones content (previously Section 5.8 and part of 5.9) so that it can be placed in **Chapter 6** (“Roadmap and Priorities”), as per your original plan. This version focuses on **technical proposals** and feature expansions, but leaves the detailed timeline and prioritization for the next chapter.

---

# 5. Technical Proposals for Next Steps

Even though **aeRAG** already handles core ingestion, chunking, and basic retrieval, several key **technical developments** are needed for the system to reach robust, production-grade status. This chapter outlines **future proposals** that will enhance aeRAG’s performance, user experience, and feature set—particularly focusing on a **minimal-yet-performant RAG engine**, **testing strategy**, **summarization improvements**, **user interface enhancements**, and **the idea of a GPT-like agent** enriched by RAG.

---

## 5.1 Minimal Yet Performant RAG Engine

### 5.1.1 Motivation
- **Immediate Testing & Validation**: To ensure reliability and gather baseline metrics, aeRAG needs a RAG engine that’s **straightforward** yet leverages a vector database for quick, similarity-based retrieval.
- **Scalable Foundation**: A “lightweight” design means simpler debugging, clearer performance data, and a stable foundation for subsequent feature expansions.

### 5.1.2 Proposed Approach
1. **Faiss Integration**  
   - **Core Step**: Store new or updated chunk embeddings in a Faiss index instead of relying solely on MongoDB for similarity searches.  
   - **Implementation**:  
     - Develop a service (e.g., `faiss_index_manager.py`) to push vectors from the `chunks` collection into Faiss.  
     - Adapt the retrieval pipeline to query Faiss for top-k results, then map back to chunk data.
2. **Light RAG Engine**  
   - **Focus**: Keep logic minimal—query embeddings, fetch top-k chunks, assemble context, and invoke the chosen LLM.  
   - **Benefit**: Clear testable steps, easier to measure latency, resource usage, and accuracy.

### 5.1.3 Advantages
- **Reduced Complexity**: Eliminates advanced multi-step logic until we have proven performance.  
- **Better Data for Tests**: With Faiss or a similar vector index, we can run systematic performance checks on speed and recall quality.

---

## 5.2 Testing Strategy: Unit, Non-Regression, and Performance

### 5.2.1 Current Gap
- **No Existing Tests**: There are no automated tests for either the collectors, chunkers, or the RAG pipeline.

### 5.2.2 Planned Testing Layers
1. **Unit Tests**  
   - **Scope**: Each module (collectors, chunking, embedding, LLM connectors) gets dedicated tests.  
   - **Example**: Verifying `GitHubCollector` properly handles pagination; confirming the chunk factory returns `CodeChunkingStrategy` for `.py`.
2. **Non-Regression Tests**  
   - **Goal**: Protect against breakage of previously functioning features as new code is introduced.  
   - **Method**: Maintain a canonical test dataset (sample code commits, issues, etc.). Each code update triggers a pipeline run, ensuring outputs remain consistent.
3. **Performance Tests**  
   - **Usage**: Evaluate retrieval speed, memory usage, and scaling.  
   - **Implementation**: Query the minimal Faiss-based engine with realistic data volume to see if it meets targeted latencies.

### 5.2.3 Release Confidence
- Once all three test layers pass, changes can be tagged as a “stable” or “release” build, ensuring production readiness.

---

## 5.3 Summarization Revisited

### 5.3.1 Observations from T5 and Mistral-7B
- **T5**: While easy to integrate, it has proven suboptimal for Archethic’s specialized content. The process is also relatively slow for large batches.  
- **Mistral-7B Instruct**: Delivers more relevant summaries but is even more GPU-heavy, raising cost and infrastructure needs.

### 5.3.2 Potential Strategies
1. **Optimized or Smaller Models**  
   - Investigate quantization, model distillation, or specialized short-input summarizers that reduce load.  
2. **Selective Summaries**  
   - Summaries are generated only for top-accessed or frequently queried chunks, conserving resources.

### 5.3.3 Benefits
- **Optional but Valuable**: Enhanced summarizations still have potential for improving retrieval context, especially if done selectively.  
- **User-Focused**: Detailed, relevant summaries help developers, investors, or community members grasp key points without parsing entire chunks.

---

## 5.4 User Interface Enhancements

### 5.4.1 Telegram or Discord Chat Integration
- **Rationale**: Users often prefer a familiar messaging platform.  
- **Telegram Bot**: Commands (e.g., `/rag "search query"`) forward to aeRAG, and the bot replies with top chunks or an LLM-generated answer.  
- **Discord Bot**: Similarly, the bot listens in specified channels, responding with context from the RAG engine.

### 5.4.2 Modern Web UI
- **Approach**:  
  - Build a minimal **React** or **Vue** single-page app that communicates with an HTTP/REST (or GraphQL) endpoint.  
  - Provide a sleek chat window, plus references for chunk sources.  
- **Benefit**: A more general interface accessible to those not using Telegram/Discord or the CLI.

---

## 5.5 GPT-Like Agent Enriched by RAG

### 5.5.1 Concept
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combine aeRAG’s domain knowledge with advanced OpenAI ChatGPT+ models.  
- **User Experience**: End users “talk to” a GPT instance that’s automatically augmented with fresh, context-specific data from Archethic repos.

### 5.5.2 Possible Implementations
1. **ChatGPT Plugin**  
   - The plugin calls aeRAG for relevant chunks whenever the user asks a domain-specific question.  
   - Must follow OpenAI’s plugin guidelines.
2. **Proxy API**  
   - A server intercepts user queries, retrieves context from aeRAG, and injects it into ChatGPT’s system prompts.  
   - Manages session and token usage carefully.

### 5.5.3 Anticipated Gains
- **Real-Time Augmentation**: Even advanced GPT models lack up-to-date or project-specific knowledge; RAG bridging solves that.  
- **Easy Adoption**: People already using ChatGPT+ can retain their workflow while gaining specialized insights on Archethic.

---

## 5.6 Additional Data Sources

### 5.6.1 Other Git Platforms
- **Adaptation**: Minimal changes for GitLab or Bitbucket collectors, reusing the GitHubCollector’s structure.

### 5.6.2 Community & Governance
- **On-Chain Proposals, Forum Threads**:  
  - Each post/proposal can be chunked and embedded, letting the user query historical or current decisions easily.

### 5.6.3 Index Refreshes
- **Scheduled Jobs**: Nightly or weekly re-checking of large sources, ensuring the knowledge base remains updated.

---

## 5.7 Logging, Analytics, and Monitoring

### 5.7.1 Structured Logging
- **Objective**: Collect queries, chunk retrieval data, and LLM latency in JSON logs.  
- **Benefit**: Facilitates debugging, usage tracking, and compliance with security or privacy standards.

### 5.7.2 Usage Analytics
- **Focus**: Identify the most common search queries or bottlenecks.  
- **Outcome**: Informs future data collection priorities, helps refine chunking or summarization.

### 5.7.3 Resource Monitoring
- **GPU/CPU Tracking**: Summarization or large LLM inferences can spike resource usage.  
- **Alerts**: DevOps can set thresholds that trigger notifications if usage is excessive or if a collector fails.

---

## 5.8 Conclusion

Implementing **Faiss-based retrieval** for a minimal RAG engine, establishing **unit/non-regression/performance tests**, optimizing **summaries**, and **enhancing user interfaces** (Telegram/Discord or a web UI) all represent critical next steps. Furthermore, the notion of a **GPT-like system**—where ChatGPT+ is seamlessly augmented by aeRAG’s specialized data—captures the long-term vision of delivering advanced, domain-aware conversations.

In **Chapter 6**, we will detail the **Roadmap and Priorities**, mapping these technical proposals onto specific milestones, timelines, and resource planning. This ensures every enhancement—whether for performance, user experience, or LLM integration—fits into a coherent path forward for aeRAG’s evolution.

## 8.2 Code Samples and Templates

### 8.2.1 Minimal Faiss Integration Snippet

```python
# faiss_index_manager.py (example)
import faiss
import numpy as np

class FaissIndexManager:
    def __init__(self, dim, index_path=None):
        self.dim = dim
        # Example: Using a simple IndexFlatL2
        self.index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dim)
        
        if index_path:
            self.load_index(index_path)

    def add_vectors(self, vectors: np.ndarray):
        # vectors shape: (num_vectors, dim)
        self.index.add(vectors)

    def search(self, query_vector: np.ndarray, top_k: int = 5):
        # query_vector shape: (1, dim)
        distances, indices = self.index.search(query_vector, top_k)
        return distances, indices

    def save_index(self, path):
        faiss.write_index(self.index, path)

    def load_index(self, path):
        self.index = faiss.read_index(path)
```

**Notes**:
- This snippet demonstrates the bare minimum for storing vectors and retrieving top-k neighbors.  
- Real-world usage: You’d likely map each vector to a `chunk_id` for referencing back to `chunks` in MongoDB.

### 8.2.2 Summarization Trigger Example

```python
def maybe_summarize_chunk(chunk_text, usage_count, summarizer):
    """ Summarize a chunk if it's heavily accessed or passes a specific threshold. """
    threshold = 10  # example usage threshold
    if usage_count > threshold:
        summary = summarizer.summarize(chunk_text)
        return summary
    return None
```

**Notes**:
- Integrates domain logic (e.g., usage_count from logs or metadata) to decide if summarization is warranted.  
- Minimizes unnecessary compute for rarely accessed chunks.

---

## 8.3 Clean Code Best Practices

aeRAG embraces **Robert C. Martin’s** “Clean Code” principles to ensure **maintainability** and **readability**:

1. **Meaningful Names**  
   - Use descriptive function/class/variable names (`fetch_commits()`, `MetadataManager`), avoiding abbreviations that obscure meaning.
2. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**  
   - Keep modules like `github_collector.py` focused on one main concern—fetching GitHub data—rather than mixing in chunking or storage logic.
3. **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)**  
   - Factor out repeated code into utility functions or base classes, e.g., `github_request.py` for common GitHub API calls.
4. **Small Functions**  
   - Limit function size to a single screenful or less, ensuring clarity. Larger logic can be subdivided into helper methods.
5. **Commenting and Docstrings**  
   - Provide docstrings at the start of each class or method clarifying purpose, parameters, and return values.  
   - Use inline comments sparingly—only when the rationale or approach is non-trivial.

## 8.4 Additional Design Patterns and Architectural Tips

1. **Factory Pattern**  
   - Used in `chunking_strategy_factory.py` to pick the correct strategy (text vs. code).  
   - Encourages future extensions (e.g., specialized chunkers for JSON configs, logs, or plain text with fewer lines).
2. **Adapter / Wrapper Classes**  
   - Could be introduced for bridging external APIs or libraries (like Faiss or a Slack/Telegram API).  
   - Keeps your core logic independent of specific library details.
3. **Microservice Architecture** *(Long-Term)*  
   - If data or user requests grow significantly, splitting the chunking pipeline, vector indexing, and LLM requests into separate services can improve concurrency and maintainability.

## 8.5 Potential Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

1. **GitHub Rate Limits**  
   - Use environment variables (e.g., `GITHUB_TOKEN`) and implement exponential backoff to avoid frequent “403 Forbidden” errors.
2. **Memory Management with Faiss**  
   - Large embeddings (millions of vectors) can exceed RAM. Investigate GPU-based indexes or sharding across multiple machines.
3. **LLM Token Limits**  
   - When merging multiple chunks for a large query, you can exceed an LLM’s context window (e.g., 8k or 32k tokens). Implement chunk pruning or summarization to fit within constraints.
4. **Summarization Quality**  
   - Domain-specific or newly introduced models (Mistral) may require custom fine-tuning for best results.  
   - Ensure your hardware (GPU VRAM) can handle the chosen model at acceptable speeds.

## 8.6 Glossary of Terms

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**:  
  AI approach that fetches relevant documents/chunks before or during generating a response.  
- **Chunk**:  
  A smaller segment of a larger document (e.g., code file, markdown docs).  
- **Embedding**:  
  A numeric vector representing text in a semantic space, enabling similarity-based searches.  
- **Faiss**:  
  A C++ library from Facebook (Meta) for efficient similarity search of dense vectors.  
- **Mistral-7B**:  
  A 7-billion-parameter LLM known for good instruction-following, albeit with higher resource demands.  
- **ChatGPT Plugin**:  
  An add-on that extends ChatGPT with domain-specific capabilities, bridging external data sources.

## 8.7 Future Reading and Exploration

1. **LangChain**: [https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain)  
   - A popular library for building LLM “chains,” relevant for multi-step reasoning in advanced RAG engines.
2. **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)**  
   - Potential method to refine LLM behavior using user feedback from aeRAG queries.
3. **Cloud-Native Vector DB Services**  
   - Vendors like AWS OpenSearch, Azure Cognitive Search, or managed Milvus services if you prefer not to self-host a vector index at scale.
